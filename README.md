# Human_Activity_Recognition
The preprocessed and normalised data was used to build machine learning models that predicted the user's activity at a given time point.
Exploratory data analysis was performed utilising several models such as PCA, LDA, t-SNE, and the data was trained on certain time series models such as ARMA, ARIMA, alongwith traditional ML models like KNN, SVM, Decision Trees etc.

Augmented Dickey–Fuller test and Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin tests were used to find out whether the data is stationary or not.
